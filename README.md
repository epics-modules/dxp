An 
[EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/) 
driver for the digital signal processor based multichannel
analyzers from <a href="http://www.xia.com">X-ray Instrumentation Associates (XIA)</a>.
These devices all contain the functional equivalent of the shaping amplifier, ADC,
and MCA of a conventional pulse-height analysis system. The term "DXP" in this document
stands for Digital X-ray Processor, and refers to all models of the XIA hardware.
