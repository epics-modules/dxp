                       DXP 3-0 Things to do

- Get non-root access to USB Saturn systems working on Linux.  
  udev does not seem to be working like it did previously?

- Make option to use INI values rather than save/restore
   - Remove save/restore for parameters
   - Set PINI=NO for DXP parameter records

- Implement correct horizontal axis scaling of baseline histogram and diagnostic traces
  
- Make a saturn.template file that changes the allowed trace mode values to those that the Saturn actually supports

- Implement SCAs
  
- When using the EPICS sscan record to do rapid data collection, the scan occasionally
  hangs up (every few hunded points) because the MCA record did not complete processing (?). 
  There are also occasional data dropouts (elapsed times and spectra are 0).
  
- Test performance when doing rapid scanning on all models, make at least as good as 2-11 corrected for small additional 
  overhead to read extra parameters to do accurate live time correction.

- Implement preset events and preset triggers on xMAP

- Don't always "apply" on xMAP when a parameter is written
  - during initialization - make PV for "autoApply", leave 0 in startup, set to 1 at end
  - When setting SCAs turn off and back on again for speed
  
- 4th xMAP module in my crate not working correctly - hardware problem?

- Mapping mode:
  - Added read rate, MBytes to medm screen
  - Test gate and sync modes together
  - Implement and test SCA mapping mode once SCAs are implemented
