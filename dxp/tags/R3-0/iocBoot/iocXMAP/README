       Instructions for installing and modifying the files in this directory.

- Make a working copy this directory to one with a site-specific name.  That way
when you install a newer version of the dxp software you will not lose your
modifications.

- This directory provides example files for 4-element and 16-element detector systems.  
If your system contains a different number of detectors, e.g. 12, then create new files 
e.g. 12element.cmd, 12element.substitutions, xmap12.ini.

- Chose a prefix for your IOC that is different from the default dxpXMAP:, so you can be sure
your PV names are unique on the subnet.  Edit the .cmd and .substutitions file, replacing all
occurances of dxpXMAP: with your prefix.

- If you are running a prebuilt version of the software then you must edit envPaths to point
to the correct locations of all of the components included in the prebuilt distribution.  Do not
worry about directories, such as EPICS_BASE, that are not included in the prebuilt distribution.

- If you are building the software yourself then edit Makefile to select the architecture you
wish to use (win32-86 or cygwin-x86).

- Edit the appropriate .ini file to set the PCI bus and slot for your xMAPs.  Alternatively, copy
a .ini file that you created with xManager into this directory.  You should set the pre-amp gain
and detector polarity correctly in this file, although you can also change them in the EPICS
medm screens and they are saved in the EPICS save/restore files.

- Decide whether you will use the Cygwin or WIN32 architecture, and edit the appropriate .BAT
file to point to the location of your medm .adl files, and the location of the areaDetector DLLs.
You also need to specify your prefix for the medm file.
