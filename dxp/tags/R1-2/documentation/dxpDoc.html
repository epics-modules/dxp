The DXP is a Digital Signal Processor based multichannel analyzer from X-ray
Instrumentation Associates.  It is a single-width CAMAC module with up to 4
input channels.  Each channel contains the equivalent electronics of the
shaping amplifier, ADC and MCA of a
conventional pulse-height analysis system.

The Saturn model has the same functionality, but is packaged as a standalone 
box, and is interfaced with an Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) interface.&nbsp; 
Support for the DXP modules under EPICS is provided in the following manner:

<OL>
<LI> Device support for the MCA record. This permits each channel of the DXP to
be connected to an MCA record identically with other supported MCA hardware,
including the Canberra AIM.
<P>
<LI> A new DXP record.  This record is used to set all of the many software
selectable parameters for the DXP, including shaping times, pileup rejection
criteria, etc.
</OL>
