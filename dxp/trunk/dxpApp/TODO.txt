Things to do on dxpApp

                                    Bugs

- Get error when loading 1element_reset.ini
- Get error when loading 16element_reset.ini
- When using 1 microsecond peaking time it looks like we run out
  of adjustment room on BASETHRESH - 256 is maximum that works,
  and Kb is still too small?
- OCR > ICR under these conditions, obviously deadtime corrections
  won't work.


                               Enhancements

- Rename iocBoot directories
- Check problem with adc_trace on DXP-2X - should be fixed now
- Check problem with baseline_history on DXP-2X - should be fixed now
- Fix problem with channel 13 not initializing in xiaStartSystem()
- Once single-threading works on DXP-2X implement multiple threads with
  locks around Handel calls
- Fit simple Gaussian to baseline histogram, give FWHM in ev
- Gain control in DXP record?
- Make a strip chart for plotting BASEMEAN, etc.
- Poll status at 60Hz in driver, callbacks to device support
- Get 3.14 medm client for Windows so long arrays work, remove 4,000 point
  limit
- Finish multi-element MEDM screens
- Make DSP parameters USHORT so they display correctly
- Track down problem with xiaSetLogOutput not set after iocInit on vxWorks
- Documentation
- Break md_epics into 3 files:
  md_epics - implements device-independent code md_wait, md_error, etc.
  md_linux - implements only EPP on Saturn
  md_vxworks - implements only CAMAC
- Saturn problems on Cygwin
  - mca record crashes system when it processes.  Not every time, but every
