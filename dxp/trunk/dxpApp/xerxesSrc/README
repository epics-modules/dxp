Readme file for the Source Distribution of the XIA XerXes
control software.  This file is not meant as a manual, it is 
meant to be an inventory of the contents of this directory.

File or Folders
---------------
xerxes.c - Source code for the library used to control all
	supported XIA products.  See the Host Software manual 
	for details.

dxp4c.c - Source code for the DXP-4C low level drivers.

dxp4c2x.c - Source code for the DXP-4C2X low level drivers.

machine_dependent_win95.c - Source code for the machine
	dependent layer of code.  This layer is the interface 
	between the DXP-4C(2X) low level drivers and the CAMAC 
	controller drivers.  If you want to control XIA 
	hardware under unix or with a CAMAC controller other 
	than the Jorway 73a, this interface layer will probably 
	have to be modified.  Use this code as a template for 
	changes.

md_linux.c - Source code for the machine dependent layer for 
	communicating with a Jorway 73a under linux.  This code
	requires the Fermilab Jorway SCSI controller library
	for Linux as well, see 
	http://www.fnal.gov/fermitools/abstracts/camac/abstract.html.
