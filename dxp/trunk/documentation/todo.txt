                       DXP 3-0 Things to do


- Initial value of pixels per buffer is wrong if it boots in mapping mode

- 4 element medm screens from 16-element - just before release.

- Make 4 and 16 element screens take $N macros so they can be used for 32,
  etc.?

- Document performance


                       DXP 3-0 Things to test
  
- Test gate and sync modes together - HAS PROBLEMS, DOCUMENT

  overhead to read extra parameters to do accurate live time correction.

- Test AutoApply and Apply
  - Measure improvement in iocInit compared to 2-10 release with 16 channel
    system
