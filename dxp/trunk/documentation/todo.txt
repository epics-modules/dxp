                       DXP 3-0 Things to do


- Does not read MCA when acquisition stops

- Add support for list-mode mapping on the xMAP - need documentation

- Initial value of pixels per buffer is wrong if it boots in mapping mode

- Value of pixels per buffer is wrong if automatic when changing from MCA Mapping to SCA Mapping or vise-versa

- Add SNL health PV to diagnose problems with SNL not connecting.

- 4 element medm screens from 16-element - just before release.

- Documentation of all the changes
  - Mapping modes
  - IDL file reading codes
  - How initial values of parameters get set (.template, .ini, save/restore)

- Make sure all parameters have corresponding PVs, and eliminate any unneeded parameters

- Need to copy data to NDArray for callbacks to work in MCA mode.  Do we care
  about this?
  

                       DXP 3-0 Things to test
  
- Test gate and sync modes together - HAS PROBLEMS, DOCUMENT

- Test saving TIFF and NeXus files

- Test support for the Mercury

- Test performance when doing rapid scanning on all models, make at least as good as 2-11 corrected for small additional 
  overhead to read extra parameters to do accurate live time correction.

- Test all preset modes on Saturn and xMAP

- Test AutoApply and Apply
  - Measure improvement in iocInit compared to 2-10 release with 16 channel
    system
    
- Test new version on:
  xMAP: win32-x86, cygwin-x86
  Saturn (EPP, USB 1, USB 2): win32-x86, cygwin-x86, linux-x86, linux-x86_64
  DXP4C2X: vxWorks
