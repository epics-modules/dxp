                       DXP 3-0 Things to do


- Does not read MCA when acquisition stops

- Add support for list-mode mapping on the xMAP - need documentation

- Get win32-x86 version working - it has problems switching modes on the xMAP

- Add SNL health PV to diagnose problems with SNL not connecting.

- 4 element medm screens from 16-element - just before release.

- Documentation of all the changes
  - Dapping modes
  - IDL file reading codes
  - How initial values of parameters get set (.template, .ini, save/restore)

- Make sure all parameters have corresponding PVs, and eliminate any unneeded parameters

- Need to copy data to NDArray for callbacks to work in MCA mode.  Do we care
  about this?
  

                       DXP 3-0 Things to test
  
- Test gate and sync modes together - HAS PROBLEMS, DOCUMENT

- Test saving TIFF and NeXus files

- Test support for the Mercury?

- When using the EPICS sscan record to do rapid data collection, the scan occasionally
  hangs up (every few hunded points) because the MCA record did not complete processing (?). 
  There are also occasional data dropouts (elapsed times and spectra are 0).
  Check this on Saturn and xMAP: still happening?
  
- Test performance when doing rapid scanning on all models, make at least as good as 2-11 corrected for small additional 
  overhead to read extra parameters to do accurate live time correction.

- Test all preset modes on Saturn and xMAP

- Test AutoApply and Apply
  - Measure improvement in iocInit compared to 2-10 release with 16 channel
    system
    
- EPP and USB1 not working on new Linux system.  Works on old Linux system?  Is this kernel, 64-bit, or what?

- Test new version on:
  xMAP: win32-x86, cygwin-x86
  Saturn (EPP, USB 1, USB 2): win32-x86, cygwin-x86, linux-x86, linux-x86_64
  DXP4C2X: vxWorks
